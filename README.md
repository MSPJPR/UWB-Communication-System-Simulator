# UWB-Communication-System-Simulator
Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create an interactive web-based application to visualize Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals. This project allows users to dynamically generate, control, and visualize different types of UWB signals, including Impulse UWB (I-UWB) and Multi-Carrier UWB (MC-UWB). The application aims to enhance understanding of UWB communication concepts and provide an engaging user experience for students and researchers.

Features

1. Dynamic Control Panel:

Sliders and dropdown menus to adjust key parameters of the UWB signals, such as pulse width, frequency, modulation type, and more.

Real-time updates based on user inputs.



2. Interactive Signal Visualization:

Visualizes UWB signals dynamically on an HTML5 <canvas> element.

Provides immediate feedback when parameters are adjusted.



3. Types of UWB Signals:

Supports Impulse UWB (I-UWB) signals.

Supports Multi-Carrier UWB (MC-UWB) signals like Frequency Hopping (FH) and Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM).



4. Responsive Design:

Fully responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile devices.

User-friendly interface with a clean and modern design.



5. Interactive Feedback:

Displays values of the parameters dynamically for better user understanding.

Provides visual confirmation of changes made to signal parameters.

File Structure

1. index.html
Contains the HTML structure with the control panel and canvas for visualization.


2. style.css
Styles the UI to be interactive, clean, and responsive.


3. script.js
Implements the logic for generating and visualizing UWB signals dynamically based on user inputs.

Usage Instructions

1. Adjust Signal Parameters:

Use the sliders and dropdowns in the control panel to modify pulse width, frequency, modulation type, etc.



2. Visualize Signal:

The canvas updates in real time based on your selections.



3. Interactive Feedback:

Parameter values are displayed next to the controls for clarity.

This project serves as a hands-on educational tool for exploring UWB communication concepts and is ideal for students studying wireless communication and signal processing.
